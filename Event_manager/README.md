Event Manager Odin Assignment with CSV Parser Class

The Dataset class is an exercise in meta-programming.

Getters setters, and the initializer are dynamically generated based on the CSV input

It does assume the first line is your headings, but it doesn't require them to be name_safe for Ruby

The EventManager module gets mixed in and handles the specific tasks we have inside the Google API
and marries those up with the data we need from the attendees list.

It's pretty verbose compared to the Odin way, but the Dataset class can be used elsewhere.
